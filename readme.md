# Color Clock

### Concept:

A clock that changes the background colour every second, slowly rotating through colours from #000000 to #235959 (I think).

### Improvements:

Implement colour translation function that either:

Maps `#000000` to `#FFFFFF` over the 864000 seconds of the day.

OR

Maps Hours, Minutes, and Days to `00` to `FF`.
